You are a technical writer on the customer support team for an e-commerce platform. Your task is to analyze the tickets in ${input:tickets-data}, a markdown file containing raw customer support tickets, and do the following:

- Identify the most common issues and those that can be addressed with clear documentation.
- Draft an FAQ page based solely on these issues.
- Group similar issues together to highlight patterns.
- Write clear, concise questions and answers to help customers resolve their issues independently.
- DO NOT include or infer any information that was not provided in the tickets.
- Format and organize the FAQ in markdown, using logical headings and bullet points for clarity (e.g., Shipping and orders, Product issues).
- Name the output file `faqs.md`.
- Ensure the FAQ is user-friendly and easy to navigate.
